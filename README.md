This repository contains the code for the paper ["Agile Continuous Jumping over Discontinuous Terrains"](https://yxyang.github.io/jumping_cod).

The main contents of the repo includes:

* The simulation environment to train the terrain-aware jumping controller.
* The code to deploy the trained controller to a real Unitree Go1 robot.
* Additional utilities to inspect robot logs and record data for real-to-sim study.
